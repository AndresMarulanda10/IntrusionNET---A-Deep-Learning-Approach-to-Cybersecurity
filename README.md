Deep Learning for Intrusion Detection using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
In today's digital world, cybersecurity is a top priority for individuals and organizations alike. With the increasing frequency and complexity of malicious attacks, traditional security measures are no longer enough. That's where Deep Learning comes in.

🧠💻🔍👀
Deep Learning techniques are being implemented in the field of cybersecurity to detect and handle issues related to intrusion, just as they have been successfully implemented in other areas such as computer vision and natural language processing (NLP).

🤖📈🆚
This project explores the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in detecting malicious attacks in terms of binary and multiclass classifications. The RNN model is compared with other popular machine learning techniques such as J48, Artificial Neural Network, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.

🔍📊📉
Through this project, we aim to contribute to the development of more efficient and accurate intrusion detection systems that can help keep our digital world safe and secure.
